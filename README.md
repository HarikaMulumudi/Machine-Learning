# Comparative analysis of the performance of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) vs Variational Autoencoder (VAE) On MNIST data Classification
Task to Accomplish: The task to accomplish in this project is to classify the images of handwritten digits into one of the ten classes, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Compare the performance of Generative Adversarial Network and Variational Autoencoder.
How I procured the data:
The data is available in the website http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ <br>
<br>
<b>There are four files:</b> <br>
Training data of images <br>
Training data of labels <br>
Testing data of images <br>
Testing data of labels <br>

<b>Programming Language used: </b>
Python

<b>Programming Platform I used: </b>
MacOs

<b> Computational Resources I used: </b>
My laptop (MacBook Pro)

<b> Libraries/ Packages I used: </b>
Keras (A deep learning API written in Python) <br> 

<b> To load the MNIST dataset:</b> TensorFlow (A free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks)
